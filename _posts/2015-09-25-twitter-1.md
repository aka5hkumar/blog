Twitter is a primary resource to guage public sentiment and opinions
about your brand, product or service.  In this multipart tutorial
series, we are going to look at how you can extract and monitor
sentiment and commentary about your brand/product/service.  In
particular, the first three parts of these series will cover the
following topics:

1. In this first part, we will get connected to twitter and start
monitoring public interest and activity in terms of the number of
tweets.
2. The next installment will demonstrate how to extend the application
to evaluate public sentiment using a sentiment analysis tool.
3. The final tutorial of the first set will describe how to discover
what people are saying via named-entity recognition and noun-phrase
extraction.
