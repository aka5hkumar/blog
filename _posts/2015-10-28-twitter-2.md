In this tutorial, we take our first look at sentiment analysis on
twitter data to track public opinion about your brand, product or
service.  This is part 2 in a series of tutorials about gauging public
interest and opinion about some topic.  [Part 1][part1] describes how
to get connected to the Twitter data feed and create a nice dashboard
to track interest in terms of the number of tweets.  Part 3 will
discuss some basic techniques for discovering what people are saying
in tweets about your topic.

In this tutorial, we'll extended the functionality of the server set
up in [part 1][part1], so you'll want to go through that one first.
There is not a lot of coding because the hard work is provided by the
[LX NLP Server][lxserver] we are using, so I'll make use of the extra
space to give some background on sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

Let's start with a <s>brief</s> longer than expected introduction to
the concept of sentiment analysis.  The goal of sentiment analysis is
to analyze a text passage and determine whether the passage expresses
an overall positive or negative attitude.  For example, *"What an
amazing performer!"* is an obviously positive statement whereas *"I
found their website really slow and hard to navigate"* is clearly
negative.  In some cases, it may also determine the passage to be
neutral if it does not express any sentiment.  Sentiment analysis is a
difficult task, even for humans.  For example, think about how
difficult it sometimes is to tell if one is being sarcastic or not.
When a statement is sarcastic, the actual sentiment is the opposite of
the one expressed.

There are two main approaches to automatic sentiment analysis: machine
learned and lexicon based.  The machine learning approach uses
algorithms designed to learn how to classify inputs by example.  The
algorithms are given a large number of example passages along with the
expected correct sentiment output and the algorithm "learns" a model
that can be applied to new texts to automatically predict the
sentiment.

The lexicon approach is based on a dictionary of words, each with an
associated positive or negative sentiment strength.  For example,
*good*, *awesome* or *nice* would have high positive values and
*ugly*, *boring* and *slow* would have high negative values.  The
overall sentiment of a passage is then some combination of the
individual sentiments of the words in it.  This approach also makes
use of a number of rules of language that modify the individual word
sentiments.  For example, there are strengtheners like *very* that
increase the magnitude of the sentiment, negators that reverse the
sentiment, etc.  The best machine learned models tend to be more
accurate than the lexicon-based algorithms.  However, machine learning
models tend to be more specific to the context used to train them and
may perform badly when applied in other contexts, whereas the
lexicon-based approaches tend to continue to perform reasonably in a
broad range of situations.  For this reason, the [LX NLP
Server][lxserver] that we are using in this tutorial employs the
lexicon-based approach.

When using sentiment analysis, bias is an important concept to
understand.  Bias means that the algorithm may produce results that
lean more towards the positive or negative side.  The bias depends not
only on the algorithm but also the context in which it's used.
Consequently, sentiment analysis results should always be considered a
relative number.  For example, if you run sentiment analysis on a set
of tweets and it reports 55% are positive, don't despair that nearly
half the tweets about you are negative.  Instead, 55% is just a
baseline that you use to compare to another.  For example, how does it
compare month over month, how does it change during a marketing
campaign or how does it compare between two different announcements.

To summarize:

* Sentiment analysis predicts whether a text passage expresses a positive or negative attitude.
* Sentiment analysis can be a difficult task.
* The lexicon-based approach generalizes well across different domains.
* The percentage of positive texts in a collection can be used as a metric of public sentiment.
* The percentage metric is relative, and should only be used in comparisons.


## Extending the Twitter client

The goal of this tutorial is to extend the Twitter client presented in
[part 1][part1] to track the sentiment of incoming tweets using the
[LX NLP Server][lxserver] API.  The server has a very simple HTTP API
for classifying a text passage's sentiment.

Add the following function to the client.js file created in [part 1][part1]
to make the API call:

~~~~~~~~~~javascript
var http = require('http');

// A function to send a tweet to the NLP server and get a sentiment score

function getSentiment(data) {
    var options = {
        hostname: 'localhost',
        port: 9000,
        path: '/nlp/sentiment?social=1',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
	    'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(data, 'utf8')
	}
    };


    var req = http.request(options, function(res) {
        res.setEncoding('utf8');
        var body = '';
        res.on('data', function (chunk) {
            body += chunk;
        });
        res.on('end', function () {
            // The NLP server returns -1, 0, or 1 sentiment score
            // Store the counts for each category in graphite
            res = parseInt(body);
            if (res > 0)
                stats.increment('sentiment.positive.count', 1);
            else if (res < 0)
                stats.increment('sentiment.negative.count', 1);
            else
                stats.increment('sentiment.neutral.count', 1);
        });
    });

    req.on('error', function(e) {
        errorLog.error('NLP Server error: ' + e);
    });

    req.write(data);
    req.end();
}
~~~~~~~~~~

There are three sections to this function:

1. **Setup options** The NLP API is served on port 9000 of the server.
The sentiment analysis request URL for short text is
`/nlp/sentiment?social=1`.  The request is a POST request because the
text to be analyzed is sent as the body of the request.  The content
body is text and the length of the text is required in the
content-length HTTP header.
2. **Callback handler** The callback function of the HTTP request
collects the response from the server in `body` and then sends metric
data to Graphite/Grafana when complete.  The sentiment analysis call
returns a single integer that is >0 for positive sentiment, <0 for
negative and 0 for neutral.  The function uses the `stats` module to
increment counters for each class so we can display the totals by
day/week/month in Grafana.
3. **Send the request with the text** The `write` method sends the post
body and the `end` method completes the request.

See the [full documentation](http://www.lexicadb.com/lxserver/nlp_http.html)
of the HTTP API for more detail.

To complete the code, add a call to `getSentiment` in the tweet
callback function so it looks something like the following:

~~~~~~~~~~javascript
stream.on('tweet', function (tweet) {
    if (tweet.text) {
        if (tweet.text.search(/[hH][tT][tT][pP][sS]?:\/\//) < 0) {
            stats.increment('twitter.tweet.count',1);
            getSentiment(tweet.text);
        } else {
            stats.increment('twitter.spam.count',1);
        }
        tweetLog.info(tweet.text);
    }
});
~~~~~~~~~~

Start up the client as before:

~~~~~~~~~~bash
/opt/node32/bin/node client.js
~~~~~~~~~~

That's it!  Try adding a single graph in Grafana with all three
metrics: sentiment.positive.count, sentiment.negative.count and
sentiment.neutral.count.  If you need help adding the graph, refer to
the final section of the [tutorial part 1][part1].  The counters will
not be available in Grafana until some data comes in, so you may need
to wait a few minutes.

I configure mine as a bar graph with the stack and percent options and
stacked values set to individual on the display styles tab.  Click the
color line in the legend to change positive to green and negative to
red.  That will give you something like the following.
